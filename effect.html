    <h4>
    Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges ha ve shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
    </h4>  <br>
    
    <h4>
    
    Our climate is determined by patterns of temperature, wind, atmospheric pressure, humidity and rain over a long period of time. There are different climates around the world, such as tropical, dry and moderate. As a large country, Australia has a variety of climates.

The climate of an area determines its seasons and when they come and go. This, in turn, affects the type of plants that grow and which animals survive. The species and places we love depend on intricate ecosystems, and even small changes to the climate can disrupt the delicate balance of nature.

As humans, every aspect of our life is reliant on the natural environment. This includes the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the clothes we wear and the products that are made and sold to create jobs and drive the economy. 

A healthy and stable climate is our most precious natural resource.
        
    </h4> <br>
        <h4>How is global warming affecting life in Australia?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ecosystems:
Global warming stresses ecosystems through temperature rises, water shortages, increased fire threats, drought, weed and pest invasions, intense storm damage and salt invasion, just to name a few. Some of Australia’s great natural icons, such as the Great Barrier Reef, are already threatened.</li>

<li> Species:
One in six species is at risk of extinction because of climate change. To survive, plants, animals and birds confronted with climate change have two options: move or adapt. With the speed of climate change we are experiencing already, it’s often not possible for a species to adapt quickly enough to keep up with its changing environment. And with the amount of habitat destruction, moving is becoming increasingly difficult.</li>
 
<li>Food and farming:
Changes to rainfall patterns, increasingly severe drought, more frequent heat waves, flooding and extreme weather make it more difficult for farmers to graze livestock and grow produce, reducing food availability and making it more expensive to buy.

<li>Water:
Reduced rainfall and increasingly severe droughts may lead to water shortages.</li>
 
<li>Coastal Erosion:
Rising sea levels and more frequent and intense storm surges will see more erosion of Australia's coastline, wearing away and inundating community and residential properties.</li>
 
<li>Health: 
Increasingly severe and frequent heat waves may lead to death and illness, especially among the elderly. Higher temperatures and humidity could also produce more mosquito-borne disease.</li>
 
<li>Damage to homes: 
Increasingly severe extreme weather events like bushfires, storms, floods, cyclones and coastal erosion, will see increased damage to homes, as well as more costly insurance premiums.</li>
 
<li>Coral bleaching:
Rising temperatures and acidity within our oceans is contributing to extreme coral bleaching events, like the 2016 event that destroyed more than one-third of the Great Barrier Reef.</li>
